# Emotion_Detection
Real-Time Emotion Detection using CNN and OpenCV detects faces from a webcam feed and classifies seven emotions—angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral—using a CNN trained on the FER2013 dataset. It displays live emotion labels with confidence scores above each detected face.
